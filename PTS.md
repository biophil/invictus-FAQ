** Receiving and backing up your PTS **
Run the client and allow it to sync with the network.

Before you send any BitsharesPTS to your wallet, you first need to encrypt the wallet. You can do this by clicking on the ‘settings’ tab and then ‘encrypt wallet’. 

It will ask you to type in a password (encryption key) twice. Use a password of at least 32 characters. It is best to not use any real words or patterns but a random string of letters (in lower case and capitals), numbers and characters such as $@^&*

Obtain the public key (receiving address) on your client. You can find this by clicking on the ‘receive’ tab on the client and copying the address shown. It will look something like this: PhVq6eidddft6Ut3dcC3RsFWYQskdmK7US

Withdraw your BitsharesPTS from your exchange to your public key. The BitsharesPTS should show up on your client’s balance after a short while.

Do not save your password on your computer or type it into any program. Your password should be written down on good old fashioned paper. You write the password down twice on two different pieces of paper for storage in different locations. DO NOT LOSE THIS PASSWORD OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PTS.

As an extra precautionary measure you can also backup your wallet by making a copy of your wallet.dat file found in %AppData%/bitsharesPTS on Windows and ~/.bitsharesPTS on Linux.

The .bitsharesPTS folder is a hidden folder.

Store your backups in multiple off-line, off-computer locations. You can store it on flash drives and cds which can be stored at different locations (such as home and work).

Once you have backed up your wallet. You can delete the wallet.dat file found in the .bitsharesPTS folder. This will remove your wallet from your computer making your wallet less vulnerable to hackers. Hackers may be able to get into your hard drive but they will find it a lot harder to get into your desk at work.

Store your wallet.dat file and pass-phrase separately. So that if someone gets hold of one they still won’t be able to get your BitsharesPTS without the other.

You should refresh this backup of your wallet.dat file at least every 99 transactions.  You need to do this because the wallet starts out with a pool of 100 key pairs that are used for transactions that require new key pairs.  Once you have used up the 100 key pairs your wallet can create new key pairs when syncing with the network. This new wallet with refreshed key pairs should then be saved. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOU CAN LOSE PTS!
