DACs are now possible because of the invention of the blockchain (which allows people to reach a global consensus on the state of a system without a central source of truth). Bitcoin can be thought of as the first DAC, though it does not aim to earn income for its shareholders. DACs run without the use of human involvement because they are governed by a set of rules that are hard corded into the software. The software is distributed globally and is audited by everyone running the software. DACs can then be used as a tool for people to do business with. These are the same properties bitcoin has!

You can pay for the services the DAC provides using shares in that DAC, the shares in the DAC have value because they are needed to make use of the services the DAC provides (with the bitcoin DAC service, bitcoins are the shares used to gain access to the service of cheap, global, fast transfer of value). Just like with flesh and blood companies you can obtain shares in the company through purchasing them or through earning them by performing tasks (like mining, or processing transactions using your computer). The main differentiator between I3 DACs and other DACs (such as bitcoin, litecoin, namecoin, datacoin etc) is that I3 DACs are designed to be profitable for shareholders.
