I3
---

I3 was founded in 2013 and is located in Virginia, USA. The novel blockchain technology (which allows people to reach a global consensus on the state of a system without a central source of truth) is what allowed bitcoin to function as a means of exchanging value. I3 sees bitcoin as being the tip of the ice-berg and they aim to use the blockchain technology to build DACs and change business the same way bitcoin has changed currency.
